Adriano Gualandi is an Assistant Professor in Geophysics at the Department of
Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge, UK, and an Official Fellow of
Clare Hall at the University of Cambridge (UK). He is also a visiting researcher
at the Italian National Earthquake Observatory section of the National Institute
of Geophysics and Vulcanology (INGV).

Prior to his current role in Cambridge, he was a researcher at the INGV in Rome
(Italy), a visiting researcher at the Ã‰cole Polytechnique in Paris (France), a
NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena (CA, USA),
and a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena (CA, USA). He studied at the University of Bologna, where he received
his PhD in Geophysics with a fellowship from INGV, and where he received his
B.S. and M.S. degrees in Physics, with a specialisation in Earth Physics.

His research mainly focuses on the study of nonlinear dynamical systems,
friction, earthquakes and geodesy. He uses satellite and remote sensing data as
well as local networks data to better understand current surface motions and the
seismic cycle.
